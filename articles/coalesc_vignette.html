<p><em><code><a href="../reference/coalesc.html">coalesc()</a></code></em> is the key function of the <em><code>ecolottery</code></em> package for coalescent-based simulation of local communities. The user can define parameters of community size, migration rate, and a custom function specifying environmental filtering, according to the situation he wants to model. He can also provide relative abundances and species trait values for the regional pool.</p>

<a href="#neutral-dynamics-in-species-pool-and-communities" class="anchor"></a>Neutral dynamics in species pool and communities</h1>
<p>Before simulating communities, we need first to define a reference pool from which immigrants are drawn. In the neutral theory (Hubbell 2001), speciation and extinction events occur randomly irrespective of species properties and drive the composition and species abundances in the reference pool (neutral speciation-drift dynamics). We can define such dynamics by setting the input argument <em><code>theta</code></em> in <em><code>coalesc</code></em> to a non-null value, and the composition of the pool can be simulated by setting <em>m = 1</em>. The simulated species abundances are then expected to follow a logseries distribution (Hubbell 2001). The fit of simulated pool composition to the logseries distribution can be estimated using the <em><code>fisherfit</code></em> function of package <em><code>vegan</code></em>.</p>

<p>We now simulate neutral communities of size <em>J = 500</em> in which immigrants from the pool establish at rate either <em>m = 0.01</em> or <em>m = 0.95</em>. In this case, all the species available in the reference pool have the same prospect of immigrating, persisting and reproducing in the local community. We can define such dynamics by setting the input argument <em><code>filt = NULL</code></em> in <em><code><a href="../reference/coalesc.html">coalesc()</a></code></em> (default value).<br>
The smaller is <em>m</em> the more local species abundances fluctuate due to stochastic demographic variations. Where <em>m</em> is close to 1, most of the dead individuals are replaced by immigrants, and local species abundances are then more closely related to regional abundances.</p>

<p>Species trait values are the legacy of evolutionary history. The processes that affect the distribution of trait values in the community can also affect the phylogenetic composition of the community depending, e.g, on the conservatism of traits among close relatives (Mouquet et al. 2012).</p>
<p>We can simulate a phylogenetic tree of the species of the reference pool, and the distribution of species trait values under an assumption of niche conservatism (Wiens and Graham 2005). In this case, descendant species can retain characteristics of their ancestors, and the trait values of more closely related species are then more similar than trait values of distantly related species (phylogenetic signal, Blomberg and Garland 2002).</p>

<p>We then simulate two communities related to this reference pool, one undergoing neutral dynamics, the other undergoing stabilizing environmental filtering. In the first case, any species of the reference pool can perform as well in the local community, and then the phylogenetic structure of the community should not be different from the structure of a random sample with same size from the reference pool. In the second case, environmental filtering limits the range of trait values in the community around an optimal value. Because more closely related species are more likely to have similar trait values in the reference pool, we then expect that the Mean Nearest Taxon Distance (MNTD) among coexisting species of the community is smaller than the average distance in the reference pool (Webb et al. 2002).</p>

<p>These patterns can be tested against a null model of random sampling in the phylogeny. The standard effect size (SES) quantifies the departure of observed phylogenetic structure from the null distribution.</p>

<p>The first community does not depart from random phylogenetic structure, while the second shows phylogenetic structuring, i.e., smaller Mean Nearest Taxon Distance than expected by chance (<em>mntd.obs.p &lt; 0.01</em>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, in the absence of niche conservatism in the phylogeny, environmental filtering in community assembly would not result in phylogenetic clustering. To illustrate this case, we shuffle the trait values of species in the reference pool, and simulate a new local community with stabilizing environmental filtering.</p>

<p>In this case, neither the neutral community nor the community with environmental filtering shows phylogenetic clustering. Therefore, when the condition of niche conservatism is not met, the absence of phylogenetic clustering does not mean that environmental filtering does not play (Mouquet et al. 2012).</p>

<p>The <em>ecolottery</em> package also includes a function <em>forward</em> to perform simulation of community dynamics from an initial composition. As for <em>coalesc</em>, the user can define the composition of the species pool from which immigrants are drawn, and can specify environmental filtering based on one or several traits.</p>
<p>We can for instance simulate stabilizing environmental filtering in a way analogous to the previous example with <em><code><a href="../reference/coalesc.html">coalesc()</a></code></em>. <em><code>d = 10</code></em> represents the number of individuals that die in the community at each time step, <em><code>prob = 0.5</code></em> represents the immigration rate at each time step. The number of simulated time steps is <em><code>gens = 500</code></em>.</p>

<p>A specific advantage of <code><a href="../reference/forward.html">forward()</a></code> is to simulate the sequence of community assembly events over time. If the birth, death and immigration probabilities depend on community composition at a specific time, the coalescent-based approach may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>In the following example, community dynamics with limiting similarity are simulated. In this case, the probability of individual death depends on the similarity of trait values of each individual to the other individuals of the community.</p>

<p>The first figure represents the temporal trajectory of the average distance of each individual to the other individuals of the community. The distance fluctuates and increases over time due to the influence of limiting similarity. The second figure shows the variation of richness, basically decreasing due to limiting similarity, until reaching stationarity.</p>
